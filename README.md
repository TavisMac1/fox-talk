This chat app is made using PHP, bootstrap and SQL. It submits the username and password from either signup or login, then the user can chat. The logged in user can flip between pages while being logged in. While logged in the user can access the chat page where they can send a message. Messages are displayed in a container with the username and message displayed. All users messages are retrieved and displayed.

Future functionality: Chat rooms, manual deletion from database, message time stamps *
